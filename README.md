Scraping mytapwater.org

I built this to scrape all zipcodes contained within mytapwater.org for all municipal water contamination data in the U.S. This code is messy, but it works. To minimize run time, I ran the code in several instalments and manually directed the program to scrape 1000 zipcodes at a time. The result is a dataset of over a million individual entries containing contaminant, contamination amount, date, zip code, water system type, water system name, and more.
